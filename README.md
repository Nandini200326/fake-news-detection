# fake-news-detection

This model is designed to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. Below are the key points to understand about this model:

1. Dataset: The model was trained on a labeled dataset containing both real and fake news articles. The dataset was preprocessed to extract relevant features for classification.

2. Features: Features used for classification include text content, metadata (such as publication source, date, etc.), and linguistic features (e.g., sentiment analysis, word frequency, etc.).

3. Model Architecture: The model employs a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks. It may also use pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT for improved performance.

4. Training: The model was trained on a portion of the dataset and validated on another to optimize its performance. Various hyperparameters and feature engineering techniques were explored to enhance accuracy and generalization.

5. Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a separate test dataset.

6. Deployment: The trained model can be deployed as a service or integrated into existing platforms for real-time fake news detection.

7. Limitations: While the model shows promising results, it may not be perfect and could misclassify some articles.
